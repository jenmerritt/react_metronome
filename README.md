**Metronome**

Warning: app plays sound if you load via Zeit Now link

Lab completed as pair programming at CodeClan (approx. 6 hours). Using ReactJS.

This was my final lab at CodeClan and so we had a bit of fun with it and chose random sounds! Plus added conditional CSS depending what had been chosen.

note: Fix needs to be made to the timing!

**Brief:**

You have been asked to create a metronome, much like the one that Google provides. Start with a range slider, play and stop buttons.

Choose this project if you want to practice:

- Working with components, state + props
- Working with intervals
- Working with sound
- Researching topics you're not familiar with

As an extension, you could:
- Allow the user to select different sounds from a list.
